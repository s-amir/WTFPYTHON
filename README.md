- ### walrus operator :=
  it used for assigne value to variable and to return the value like (a:=1)
  print (num:=1)  
  -usage : if (j:=1+3) > 4: print(11)  
  in this statement it assgine value to variable j and return it too  
  (better than using = operator)   
  x = (a := 696, 9)   
  x  
  (696, 9)  
  a  
  696
- ### Be careful with chained operations  
  False is False is False  
  True  
  HOW? > (False is False) and (False is False)
- ### is VS ==:  
  is check reference while == check value:  
  5 == 5.0 == 5 + 0j  --> True 
  5 is 5.0 is 5+ 0j --> False  (beacuse of type difference)
